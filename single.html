              Owen Hanson woke up in his own bed for the last time on September
              9, 2015. He had a 7:20 tee time that morning in Carlsbad, a San
              Diego suburb about a hundred miles south of his Beverly Hills
              home, and he was running late. He threw his clubs in the back of
              his Porsche, pulled onto the 405, and tore out at 100 miles per
              hour to beat the traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson was 33 years old, with a beautiful wife, numerous
              apparently successful business ventures, a good relationship with
              his family, and strong ties to Redondo Beach, the insular coastal
              community where he grew up. He graduated from the University of
              Southern California, where he had been an outside hitter on the
              volleyball team and a walk-on tight end during the Pete Carroll
              glory years. He was charming, with a big smile, and well-spoken in
              the kind of way that put you at ease instead of intimidating you.
              He was a high roller in Las Vegas and well connected in Los
              Angeles. He was tall and fit, and his portfolio was diversified.
            </p>
            <p>
              But Hanson had a bad feeling driving down to Carlsbad that
              morning. He was meeting a man named Al Wilson. He and Wilson had
              been seeing a lot of each other over the past few months. They
              played golf at expensive courses for high stakes. Wilson once
              invited him to Miami to check out his cigarette boat. He took
              Hanson and his wife, Crista, out to thousand-dollar dinners—and
              then tipped fifty percent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson and Wilson were business associates, and they were becoming
              friends. But something was off about it. When Hanson pulled into
              the country club's parking lot that morning, he saw that it was
              totally empty. That seemed wrong to him—7:20 wasn't even the first
              tee time of the day. But then again, Hanson thought, maybe I'm
              being paranoid. After all, I'm a little early.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              Hanson drove out of the lot and picked up breakfast at McDonald's
              and thought things over. Maybe this was it. Maybe he shouldn't
              drive back to the club at all. Maybe he should just get back on
              the freeway and keep heading south—drive down to Mexico, cross the
              border, and never look back. He had resources down there. Crista's
              family was there. He was building a house in Cabo San Lucas. Then
              his cell phone rang. I'm in the clubhouse getting ready, Wilson
              said. Where are you?
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson drove back to the course. This time there was a single
              vehicle in the parking lot: a giant F-350 pickup. You don't see
              trucks like that in the parking lots of country clubs, Hanson
              thought. When the attendant came to take his golf clubs, Hanson
              asked him about the truck. Was it the gardener or something? What
              was going on?
            </p>
            <p>
              The attendant said he didn't know, took the clubs, and walked
              away. That's when Hanson saw the helicopter overhead. Federal
              agents began emerging from the trees with their guns drawn. It was
              like watching a movie, Hanson recalls, only he was in it. They
              were all there for him. Thirty agents, it must have been. He saw
              them lead Wilson out of the clubhouse in cuffs, too. "Don't talk
              to him!" they were yelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson was placed in an SUV and driven to an office somewhere
              nearby. Two men in the front seat, and one in the back with him.
              The guy riding shotgun didn't say a word the whole time. Only when
              they got into an interrogation room did he finally introduce
              himself. He was with the New South Wales Police. Here from Sydney,
              Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              The moment Hanson heard the Australian accent, he knew he really
              was in trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson has now been in federal custody for more than a year.
              Initially, he was arrested on drug charges, but a few months later
              the charges against him were expanded as the FBI made another
              sweep of arrests. In total, 22 people were accused of being
              members of what the U.S. Attorney's Office deemed a "sophisticated
              international criminal enterprise" called ODOG.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson, who sometimes went by the nickname O-Dog, was the alleged
              ringleader. The full charges against him include conspiracy to
              distribute cocaine, conspiracy to distribute narcotics, RICO
              conspiracy, running an illegal gambling business, and
              money-laundering conspiracy. In a recent hearing, Assistant U.S.
              Attorney Andrew Young alleged that Hanson trafficked more than a
              ton of cocaine.
            </p>
            <p>
              He faces up to life in prison in the United States, as well as
              possible extradition to face charges in Australia. Among the
              alleged co-conspirators listed in the ODOG indictment are a former
              NFL running back, a beachfront restaurant owner, a
              down-on-his-luck Hollywood private investigator, a San Diego
              accountant, a general contractor who had once managed a famous
              African musician, an American expat in Peru, and a career criminal
              known as Tank.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              "It sounds like a good crime novel," Hanson's former defense
              attorney Russell Babcock said in court last year.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a decade, Owen Hanson went from being a well-off kid from
              Redondo Beach to the subject of a major FBI investigation. To the
              outside world, he presented the image of a successful real-estate
              developer, but he was also a person so feared by his debtors that
              they refused to call the police on him even as their lives
              crumbled. Many of those still fear him, even as he sits in a
              prison cell.
            </p>
            <p>
              The full accounting of Hanson's criminal rise and fall—which
              includes, among other details, a lucha libre mask, a suitcase full
              of cash hidden in the ceiling of an apartment in Australia, and a
              man who calls himself Robin Hood 702—has yet to play out in court.
              But through publicly available court records and interviews with
              Hanson and people who have known him, it's possible to piece
              together a story that does justice to his former attorney's
              statement. Owen Hanson's life would make a good crime novel—which
              makes it even harder to believe that it's all real.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's how Owen Hanson's football career started: Toward the end
              of his sophomore year at USC, Hanson said he was in the weight
              room with some of his volleyball teammates when a football
              assistant walked by. That particular day, as the football
              assistant stood and watched, Hanson benched 25 reps of 225
              pounds—three more reps than his future teammate Clay Matthews
              would put up at the 2009 NFL combine. Afterward, the assistant
              approached Hanson and asked if he would consider trying out for
              football.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time, USC football was on its meteoric rise under Pete
              Carroll. Six months earlier, Carson Palmer had led the Trojans to
              victory in the Orange Bowl and the team's first top-five finish
              since 1978. In a city where there hadn't been pro football for
              more than a decade, USC was quickly becoming a glamour franchise.
              Hanson saw all this. Even though he had never played football in
              his life, he decided to take the coach up on his offer. He ran a
              4.6 second 40-yard dash in his tryout, and posted a 35-inch
              vertical leap. He made the team as a walk-on.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that was a microcosm of Owen Hanson's life. One friend, a high
              school volleyball teammate who asked not to be identified,
              described Hanson's life as "surreal."
            </p>
            <p>
              "We pretty much grew up at the beach," he said. "I don't mean
              figuratively." He meant skating and surfing and playing
              volleyball. Partying a little as they got older.
            </p>
            <p>
              "We didn't have a lot of adversity we didn't create for
              ourselves."
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson's parents split up when he was eight years old. He grew up
              with his dad, Jim, on a quiet street. Jim Hanson worked for 35
              years as a contractor with one of LA's biggest real-estate
              developers; he and his brother—Hanson's uncle—were fixtures in the
              Redondo Beach volleyball scene. Hanson followed in their
              footsteps.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a teenager, Hanson won a junior national beach volleyball
              tournament. The local paper, the Daily Breeze, named him their
              men's volleyball player of the year at Redondo Union High School.
              Girls liked Hanson. Guys liked Hanson. "He was buff and he was
              fast and he was athletic," said his high school volleyball coach
              Tommy Chaffins. He even got good grades, Chaffins said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Former teammates recall Hanson walking around campus shirtless on
              volleyball game days, flashing a toothy smile around at everybody.
              "Between tenth and eleventh grade, Owen Hanson went from a tall
              skinny kid to looking like a WWE wrestler," one classmate said.

          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              At USC, Hanson was a reserve on the volleyball team. He also
              joined a fraternity, Beta Theta Pi. The frat disbanded in 2003,
              his junior year, after repeated disagreements with campus
              officials about the maintenance of their house. Many of the
              members moved to a nearby apartment complex and formed a group
              called Stumpo's Raiders.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Too much booze, cocaine, partying as a fraternity," Hanson wrote
              to me from prison about his Greek experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson may have been a big partier in college (and after), but
              according to people who knew him, he never gave off the impression
              of being violent in those days. One friend told me he was
              surprised Hanson tried out for football, because he didn't think
              the sport was suited to Hanson's personality.
            </p>
            <p>
              "He was just a happy-go-lucky guy," a USC classmate told me. "Nice
              guy. Not violent at all to my knowledge. More of like a fun guy
              who lifted weights and had tattoos and eventually had his tattoos
              taken off."
            </p>
            <p>
              Those tattoos appeared after Hanson joined the football team: the
              LA skyline, angels and devils, the words "SOUTH BAY" down the
              middle of his back. Friends from back in Redondo Beach say that
              once Hanson got to USC, he didn't stay in touch as much as he used
              to, and started running with a different crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson told me he began to use steroids early in college, and that
              he was juiced when the football coach saw him that day in the
              weight room. After he made the football team, he timed his steroid
              use for summers, when the NCAA wasn't testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even now, more than a decade later, Hanson remains a proud Trojan.
              Earlier this year, I wrote to him at the Metropolitan Correctional
              Center in San Diego, the federal facility where he awaits trial.
              He responded very promptly with an email via Corrlinks—a monitored
              messaging program used by federal inmates. He signed his message:
            </p>
            <p>Fight On!!</p>

              The visiting rooms at MCC San Diego are narrow and bleak. Visitors
              wait, sometimes for hours, in a park across from the prison for
              their turn to file in, ride the elevator up to their floor, and
              spend an hour with a loved one. They pull their chairs close
              without making physical contact. On the tenth floor, where Hanson
              is housed, there are eight chairs and a couple tables that nobody
              uses pushed up against a wall. A poster hanging next to the clock
              encourages inmates to be active fathers. Hanson's own father, Jim,
              visits him often. So do his mom, his wife, his sister, even the
              occasional USC teammate.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his khaki prison uniform, Hanson practically swallows up the
              chair beneath him. He isn't tight-end-sized anymore, but he's
              still big, with big, expressive features. His hair is gelled and
              parted. He wears black and white Nikes. The first time I met him,
              he complained that he'd lost his tan because he gets only one hour
              outside per week. He's an orderly on his floor, a status that
              allows him to joke around with guards a little bit. It also gives
              him relatively free access to Corrlinks, the messaging system.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our correspondence and in-person conversations, Hanson was open
              to discussing aspects of his life that didn't involve the charges
              he was facing. He was happy, for example, to tell stories about
              playing volleyball or trying to tackle Reggie Bush in practice. I
              couldn't bring a recording device, or even pen and paper, into MCC
              San Diego, which is why I do not quote at length from our
              conversations in this story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our visits mainly left me with an impression of Hanson as being an
              easy person to get along with—the kind of person you like, even
              when you think he might be bullshitting you. It was easy to
              picture him as a great salesman—of real estate, of a sportsbook,
              of drugs...of anything, really.
            </p>
            <p>
              After college, Hanson followed his father into the development
              business. He got his real-estate license in 2006, when he was 24,
              and set about selling homes in the South Bay, where he grew up. To
              build his brand, Hanson turned to a web designer named Jeremy
              Broekman, who became a friend. When I asked Broekman what he could
              recall about Hanson in those days, he settled on a message Hanson
              had him include at the bottom of each page of that first site. The
              title of the message was "Helping You Conquer the American Dream":
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't play the lottery. I don't have the winning ticket.
              Everything I have I busted my butt for. The only thing I ever got
              handed to me are the genetics that my old man passed down. From
              him I learned the value of a hard work ethic and getting your
              hands dirty. To those who have always wanted more, stand with me.
              We are few. We must stand on the mountaintops to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Broekman described Hanson as an "upwardly mobile yuppie type."
              Hanson took care of the people in his life, and he liked to enjoy
              the fruits of his labor, Broekman said. He was fun to be around
              and easy to work for. One time, Hanson paid for Broekman to set up
              a website for his sister's dog-walking business, but didn't want
              her to find out that he had been the one behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website Broekman built for Hanson, OwenSells.com, featured
              images of Hanson in a suit superimposed over the New York skyline
              (even though he lived and worked in Los Angeles). There were
              photos of Hanson with USC teammates, with President George W. Bush
              during the national championship USC team's White House visit,
              with Paris Hilton, with Tommy Lasorda. There was even music that
              automatically played once the page loaded: "Push it to the Limit,"
              the synth-heavy pop song that was written for the movie Scarface
              and plays during the famous montage of Al Pacino living the high
              life as a cocaine dealer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It all played into the man-about-town persona Hanson was
              cultivating now that he was out of college—a successful
              entrepreneur simultaneously living hard and living well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then 2008 happened, and the bottom fell out of the real-estate
              market. Hanson found himself strapped for cash. People weren't
              buying houses, not even the luxury homes he was selling. It was
              around this time that Hanson became affiliated with an outfit
              called Macho Sports. In many ways, Macho Sports was a precursor to
              the ODOG enterprise: a massive offshore sports-betting operation
              based in Peru that was known among sports gamblers for paying out
              reliably and collecting debts aggressively—often violently,
              according to a criminal complaint filed against them in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson got involved with Macho Sports through his father. Jim
              belonged to a fly-fishing club with an elementary school teacher
              who also happened to be an agent for Macho Sports. Hanson started
              betting with the teacher/agent, which eventually led to him
              becoming a protégé of Jan Portocarrero, who ran the operation with
              his brother Erik. (Macho Sports has since been broken up in a RICO
              case of its own.)
            </p>
            <p>
              It also led him to launching his own online sportsbook, Betodog
              (the name again taken from Hanson's nickname). At first, Betodog
              operated as a skin of Macho Sports—a different book on the
              outside, but the same software underneath. Hanson wasn't competing
              with the Portocarreros so much as joining them in the marketplace
              as a partner. One gambler I interviewed referred to Betodog as
              "the little brother of Macho."
            </p>

          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              Like Macho Sports, Betodog quickly developed a reputation for
              paying out promptly and for going to great lengths to collect on
              unpaid debts. Whereas many illegal sportsbooks are shoddy and
              short-lived, Betodog and Macho were professional and well
              organized, according to former clients who spoke to VICE Sports;
              they seemed well suited to grow in what remains a massive market.
              The American Gaming Association, a trade group that promotes
              gambling legalization, projects that $90 billion will be bet on
              American football in 2016, $88 billion of that through illegal
              books.
            </p>
            <p>
              "We ran it like a Fortune 500 company," Hanson told me. According
              a person close to Hanson, the man at the controls of Betodog was
              an American expat in Peru named Kenny Hilinski. Hilinski, who has
              pleaded guilty to a count of RICO conspiracy and awaits
              sentencing, operated sort of like a COO. In a text message
              intercepted by the FBI and listed in a motion filed by
              prosecutors, Hilinski identified himself to one gambler as "O's
              manager." On Sunday nights after a football weekend, he would send
              out invoices to bettors outlining what they had earned or what
              they owed.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to one client, winnings would always arrive promptly on
              Mondays after a football weekend. If you lost, the expectation was
              that the book's courtesy would be returned by the gambler. If it
              wasn't, the client said, Hanson would not hesitate to resort to
              other methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Betodog and Macho had a vast network of collectors on payroll who
              were quick to act—another way the outfits were different from
              typical sportsbooks. They are accused of applying all manner of
              psychological pressure on indebted gamblers: threatening force,
              calling family members, breaking into homes. Jan Portocarrero was
              accused by the government of bragging about stealing the cars of
              delinquent gamblers. According to a motion filed by the
              prosecution, one of Hanson's co-defendants, Jack Rissell, emailed
              evidence to Hanson that he beat up an indebted gambler in
              Minnesota.
            </p>
            <p>
              One longtime sports gambler who played with Betodog recalled
              Hanson, then in his late 20s, bossing around men 30 and 40 years
              his senior. The gambler described Hanson in starkly amoral terms—a
              "savant businessman," "brilliant."
            </p>
            <p>
              "As far as liquidity, speed of payment, and all-around
              professionalism, he was one of the best bookies I've ever seen."
            </p>
            <p>
              According to a source close to Betodog, Hanson's gambling
              operation accepted every manner of payment: wire transfers,
              checks, cash, gold, silver, property, even bitcoin. One time,
              there was a catamaran. Hanson often used untraceable gold and
              silver coins as currency in his own betting. When he was arrested
              last year, FBI agents seized 500 silver coins and 26 ten-ounce
              silver bars from his home, according to court transcripts.

            <p>
              In 2010, Hanson was arrested for possession of steroids. He lost
              his real-estate license as a result, but by then OwenSells.com had
              become a quaint reminder of Hanson's earlier ambitions. Now he was
              the guy his first website made him out to be; he was already
              standing on the mountaintop. Betodog was a success.
            </p>
            <p>The problem was, Hanson wanted to keep climbing.</p>
            <p>
              And so, according to the indictment, Hanson became a drug dealer.
              He is accused of selling cocaine, GHB, and ecstasy. Most of his
              bettors had no idea, but while they were gambling on NFL games,
              Hanson was allegedly using his connections from his USC days to
              sell drugs to at least one football player; the indictment alleges
              that at one point Hanson FedExed cocaine and ecstasy to a NFL
              player in Nashville. Another of Hanson's co-defendants is Derek
              Loville, the former Super Bowl–winning running back, who is
              accused in the indictment of dealing drugs. (Loville did not
              respond to calls from VICE Sports.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson also found a market far from home, and far from the world
              of American football: Australia. It's unclear exactly how Hanson
              wound up there, but Australia would be the site of some of his
              greatest glories as a drug dealer. It would also turn out to be
              the place where a convoluted series of events began that still
              haunt Hanson, and will, he said, for the rest of his life. It all
              began when he met a professional gambler named Robin Hood 702.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I wish I never met that guy," Hanson told me during one of my
              visits to MCC San Diego.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some months earlier, the man called Robin Hood had told me the
              same thing.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              Hanson was in Sydney, Australia, in May of 2011 when Craig
              Haeusler knocked on the door of his rental apartment, a rolling
              suitcase behind him. Haeusler had previously served five years for
              selling meth in the Sydney suburbs. He was delivering cash:
              $702,000 Australian, all in $50 bills.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2011, Hanson was already a successful bookmaker. And in
              Australia, he could capitalize on the high demand for and limited
              supply of cocaine. At his bail hearing, prosecutors revealed that
              Hanson allegedly told an undercover agent that he sold cocaine in
              Australia for $175,000 per kilo. For the sake of comparison, the
              going rate for a kilo in Hanson's hometown of Los Angeles is
              closer to $20,000. That's an 875 percent markup.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Australian newspaper reports, associates there called
              Hanson "Dispose" because of his tendency to frequently change
              hotel rooms and cell phone numbers. The word could also describe
              Hanson's alleged behavior when it comes to the large quantities of
              cash in his possession.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to a related ruling in a New South Wales court, Hanson
              was due to travel soon after he received the 702,000: first to
              Perth to visit an aunt who was suffering from cancer, and then
              back to Los Angeles for a few weeks. Instead of taking the cash to
              a safe deposit box or a trusted associate, Hanson decided to stash
              the suitcase in a crawlspace in the ceiling of his rental
              apartment. He'd leave it there even as other tenants stayed in the
              apartment while he was gone.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Hanson's world, sports gambling and money laundering were
              inextricably connected to the drug trade. In fact, he had met
              Haeusler, the convicted drug dealer who delivered the cash,
              through a mutual gambling connection. According to a person close
              to his operation, Hanson's best gambling clients were drug
              dealers. So the transition from gambling into drug trafficking was
              very natural. It felt inevitable, even. Eventually, the source
              said, Hanson preferred the drug business.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the drug trade, things were cut and dry. People tended to pay
              their debts on time. The stakes were higher, both financially and
              legally, which made everybody sharper and more careful. Bullshit
              was not tolerated. People didn't shirk responsibilities. Nobody
              lost fifty grand on a game and then claimed to be out of town the
              next week, the person close to Hanson's operation explained.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Hanson's drug business grew, and he began to take bigger risks,
              he also began to think more internationally. In bail hearings, the
              government has said that he bought a house in Costa Rica and
              another in Peru under an associate's name, and that he obtained a
              Mexican ID under the name Michael Zepeda Ortiz and bought the
              property for his home in Cabo San Lucas under that name. Per bail
              hearing transcripts, Hanson also told an undercover agent that his
              wife's family was helping him obtain Mexican citizenship and a
              false passport under a different name.

            <p>
              According to the Australian ruling, Hanson returned to Sydney and
              the apartment in June 2011. Soon thereafter, he met a pair of
              American women named Soul and Barb at his gym, who then introduced
              him to a personal trainer named Sean Carolan. Carolan had his own
              shady history as a cage fighter, horse trainer, and
              scandal-plagued nutritionist for an Australian rugby club.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson and Carolan planned to open a series of weight-loss clinics
              by importing something called a Zerona Laser ("the first
              non-invasive body contouring procedure to effectively remove
              excess fat without the negative side effects associated with
              surgical methods"). Hanson was going to invest some of the
              $702,000 he still had stored in the ceiling of his apartment,
              according to the Australian ruling. The clinic would have been an
              ideal way to launder some of the cash Hanson was making in the
              country, and perhaps a successful business in its own right.
              Hanson did, in fact, import one of the lasers to Australia. They
              really work, he told me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way Hanson discovered he could launder cash was through
              casinos. While he and Carolan were plotting their weight-loss
              empire, Hanson was also meeting with Robin Hood 702, a
              professional gambler who has been featured in various news stories
              for giving his winnings to poor families. They had been introduced
              to each other by Hanson's wife, Crista, whom Robin Hood 702 said
              he used to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been using the name Robin Hood 702 here because that's what
              Hanson called him while they did business together. The gambler's
              real name, which he guards closely, is R.J. Cipriani. He's a six
              foot five middle-aged Philadelphian with a booming voice and a
              knack for drawing a crowd. Turner produced a reality-show pilot
              about him at one point, but it didn't get picked up.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Hanson and Cipriani first met in Australia, neither man was
              using his real name. Hanson was going by Junior DeLuca, a
              pseudonym he often used for business, and Cipriani was going by
              the Robin Hood 702 moniker.
            </p>
            <p>
              After having a coffee, Hanson invited Cipriani to an apartment in
              Sydney, where he handed him a suitcase filled with a million
              dollars Australian, all in $50 bills. Cipriani recalled to me that
              after a short conversation, Hanson opened a kitchen cabinet to
              reveal what appeared to be millions more in cash. Hanson took out
              another $500,000 and placed it in a second bag, which he also
              handed to Cipriani.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani told me that he thought Hanson was staking him in
              blackjack: he'd have to pay back the principle, but anything he
              made, he'd give to families in need. Before accepting the money,
              Cipriani says, he repeatedly reminded Hanson that blackjack is a
              game of chance—there was a strong possibility he could lose it
              all. But Hanson did not seem worried. He told Cipriani that he
              believed in him as a gambler and was not concerned about losing
              the money. Crista had vouched for him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is where Hanson and Cipriani's accounts begin to diverge.
              Hanson says that Cipriani's version of the events in Australia is
              false, but he could not elaborate or provide details, as his case
              is still awaiting trial. One source close to Hanson told me that
              Cipriani was paid a percentage of the principle to launder the
              money in the casino—that it was all arranged beforehand. Cipriani
              denies this. (Hanson, it bears noting, is also alleged to have
              offered an undercover agent a fee of 8 percent to launder cash,
              according to transcripts from a bail hearing.)
            </p>
            <p>
              In court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Young alleged that Hanson
              instructed Cipriani to take the $1.5 million, go up or down a few
              hundred thousand dollars, and then take the casino check to Las
              Vegas and cash it there. That money, finally, would go to Hanson.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a neat and easy way for Hanson to launder cash, and
              apparently it all went smoothly. Cipriani did indeed play cards in
              Australia, win almost $300,000, travel to Las Vegas with a check
              for almost $1.8 million, and cash out there (the exchange rate
              between American and Australian dollars in 2011 was close to
              one-to-one). Eventually, Cipriani handed the money over to Hanson
              back in the States. Then, in August, Cipriani returned to
              Australia. Hanson, according to bail hearing transcripts, wanted
              him to try the same thing again—this time with $2.5 million.
            </p>
            <p>
              But very quickly, Hanson and Cipriani's relationship fell apart.
              Cipriani told me that right before accepting the $2.5 million, he
              got a bad feeling. Hanson's tone had changed, he said. In the
              course of a few conversations in Cipriani's suite at the Four
              Seasons in Sydney, Hanson allegedly went from charming to
              demanding. Cipriani told me no longer wanted any part of Owen
              Hanson.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani claims that Hanson insisted he take the $2.5 million
              anyway, and that Hanson brought up Cipriani's wife, a Brazilian
              model and actress named Greice Santo—a big deal, considering the
              two men were still using pseudonyms. Cipriani accepted the money,
              and also a burner cell phone he could use to stay in contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unsure of what to do about Hanson, Cipriani told me that he
              decided to "leave it up to the gambling gods," which he did by
              continuously placing max bets—$20,000 per hand, playing multiple
              spots—even as his luck ran dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              He told me that he held off Hanson for as long as he could before
              revealing that he had blown the money. Hanson, Cipriani says, did
              not take the news well.
            </p>
            <p>And this is where things get really complicated.</p>
            <p>
              Hanson wanted to meet with Cipriani, and he invited Carolan, the
              trainer and former MMA fighter, along. Cipriani believes that
              Hanson wanted Carolan there to talk about the blown $2.5 million.
              Send a message. By this point, Hanson had also given the $702,000
              that had been stashed in his apartment ceiling—the money they were
              going to invest in the weight-loss clinic—to Carolan for
              safekeeping at his home in Sydney, according to Carolan's suit.
              Instead, Carolan stashed the cash in a room he reserved at the
              nearby Hilton while he and Hanson met up with Cipriani at The
              Star.
            </p>
            <p>
              The three men sat down for a tense conversation in a restaurant at
              the casino about the blown $2.5 million. During the conversation,
              Cipriani says, Carolan threatened to slit his throat and his
              wife's throat. They also asked for Cipriani's passport so he
              couldn't leave the country. Cipriani was able to negotiate three
              hours to go gather his friend Rick Leventhal, a Fox News reporter
              who had accompanied him to Australia and was gambling, and said he
              would wait for a call from Carolan.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Carolan called, he told Cipriani to meet him in his room at
              the Hilton. Instead of going to the hotel, Cipriani says he called
              Hanson using the burner phone and made up a story about being
              followed, hoping to discourage Hanson from doing just that. Then,
              he says, he called hotel security at the Hilton and reported a gun
              up in Carolan's room. Hotel security called the local police. The
              police never found a gun, but they did find the $702,000, which
              they promptly confiscated. Carolan was arrested. Cipriani and
              Hanson both left the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani claims that the $702,000 was meant for him, and that
              Hanson wanted him to deposit it at The Star Casino without playing
              a single hand, get a check, give it to Hanson, and meet him back
              in the States to cash it at a casino in Vegas. He didn't know how
              much money Hanson planned to give him at the time, but in
              retrospect, to him, the fact that it was $702,000 was no
              coincidence. After all, Cipriani points out, his pseudonym is
              Robin Hood 702—as in the area code for Las Vegas.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Australian court said that the amount was related to the
              exchange rate at the time. Those close to Hanson told me that
              there's no way he would have given Cipriani even more money after
              he blew the $2.5 million. In any case, the $2.5 million was
              gone—and so was the $702,000, seized by the Australian government.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the ensuing years, Carolan mounted a legal effort to claim
              ownership of the $702,000, but failed. Hanson and Cipriani,
              meanwhile, returned to Los Angeles. Both men, it turned out, lived
              there. Cipriani didn't know that at the time. He initially felt
              like he had dodged a bullet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, Cipriani says, Hanson showed up at the concierge desk of his
              apartment building in Santa Monica.

            <p>"You have found the fucking story of your life."</p>
            <p>
              R.J. Cipriani was my first contact in reporting this article. In
              retrospect, that is the way it had to be. Cipriani has, in many
              ways, been the narrator of the Owen Hanson story as it has played
              out in the American press.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I began to follow Hanson's story after his arrest last year,
              I saw the name Robin Hood 702 in Australian newspaper reports.
              Curious, I sent Cipriani a note. Moments later, I received a call
              from a private number, and a loud, deep voice made that
              declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani's website, RobinHood702.com, describes Robin Hood 702 as
              "a mysterious gambler who hands money to poor families," but he's
              not completely mysterious: he has been in the news dozens if not
              scores of times over the years. A cursory internet search at the
              time we first spoke led me to an ABC News item, "Real Life Robin
              Hood Rescues Man from Fire." There were many others like it, all
              describing Robin Hood 702's various heroics as a man of the
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many ways, R.J. Cipriani is a more compelling and mysterious
              figure than his alter ego. He grew up in a blue-collar Italian
              family in Philadelphia; as a teenager, he worked baking and
              delivering soft pretzels. In the early 1980s, Cipriani said he
              found himself in a romantic rivalry with a member of the Pagans
              Motorcycle Club. The biker beat him over the head with a sawed-off
              axe handle. Then Cipriani shot him seven times in the leg. He was
              exonerated for reasons of self-defense, his lawyer confirmed. He
              later opened an insurance adjustment company.
            </p>

          <figure class="image mb-30 m-auto text-center border-radius-10">
            <img
              class="border-radius-10"

          </figure>
          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              Cipriani spent the mid and late 90s caring for his mother Regina,
              who had Alzheimer's. After she passed away, in 2000, he moved to
              Florida, then Las Vegas, before finally landing in Santa Monica,
              where he took on the identity of Robin Hood 702. It is, he says, a
              tribute to his mother. He goes to church every day to light a
              candle for her, he told me. He also happens to work regularly as a
              confidential human source for the FBI. He said the code name they
              assigned him is Jackpot.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the gambling, Cipriani had been playing cards in Atlantic
              City since he was 16 years old, sneaking into casinos while he was
              still underage. Things had gone relatively smoothly, at least for
              a professional gambler—until Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after he returned to Los Angeles, Cipriani told me, he began
              to feel pressure from Hanson. At one point, Cipriani says, he
              approached the FBI in Philadelphia under a proffer letter, which
              granted him immunity. He says he dialed into a conference call wit
              federal agents and an Assistant U.S. Attorney and told the story
              of what happened in Australia. Nobody in the room believed him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearly a year after they returned from Australia, Cipriani says,
              Hanson invited him to fly down to Costa Rica to meet and discuss
              the debt—a debt that Cipriani says he did not believe he really
              owed, but had already caused him a great deal of stress. Once in
              Costa Rica, according to Cipriani, an associate of Hanson's
              threatened him with a gun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani fled the scene and the country. Assistant U.S. Attorney
              Young recounted Cipriani's story at a Hanson bail hearing, and
              said that his travel to Costa Rica had been verified by government
              officials.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same month Cipriani fled Costa Rica, Hanson hired a private
              investigator to dig up everything he could about Cipriani and his
              wife, Greice. That private investigator, Daniel Joseph
              Portley-Hanks, is the sixth listed co-defendant in Hanson's RICO
              case. He is charged with criminal conspiracy, forfeiture, and
              operating an illegal gambling business, but Portley-Hanks believes
              that he is actually a victim of Owen Hanson.
            </p>
            <p>"There's no future-bad-guy database," he told me.</p>
            <p>
              Portley-Hanks is a well-regarded PI in the entertainment industry,
              who, if given the opportunity, will talk your ear off for an hour
              about the origins of the LexisNexis database. Heavyset, with curly
              hair and a propensity for catching you off-guard with a dirty
              joke, he goes by Danno, not Daniel. He operates his business,
              Backstreet Investigations, out of a one-bedroom apartment in the
              San Fernando Valley. The walls of his apartment are covered in
              plaques honoring his contributions to the safety of various
              communities, letters of commendation, and photos he took with
              various celebrities—BB King caught my eye—while he worked in
              private security.
            </p>
            <p>
              During a conversation we had in his apartment, Danno accepted a
              collect call from an inmate in a Clark County, Nevada, jail.
              Afterwards, he explained to me that a stripper friend of his in
              Las Vegas was locked up for DUI, and concerned about her pet
              Maltese Sadie, who was at home without her. I listened as Danno
              assured her that he was taking care of everything, sending a
              mutual friend over to feed the dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno enlisted in the Marines out of high school. He served as a
              medic—he said he refused to carry a gun; he's not a violent
              person—and was in Vietnam for just two days before he got shot
              through the shoulder and sent home. In the 1970s, he was convicted
              of stealing cars and aiding in a burglary. He became a jailhouse
              lawyer, and got himself exonerated on a technicality in a case
              that went all the way to the Supreme Court. After he got out of
              prison, he answered a want ad for a private investigator. He
              worked for decades under the man who would eventually be his
              partner, Fred Valis.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1980s, Danno and Valis became highly decorated FBI
              informants when they infiltrated the Gambino crime family and
              brought down—ironically, it would turn out—one of the world's
              biggest bookies, Ron "The Cigar" Sacco. They were featured on 60
              Minutes. Sacco called Valis "pestilence" and Danno "vermin." Danno
              had turned his life around. He worked security for major musical
              acts. He finally was able to obtain a certificate of
              rehabilitation and get his own license as a private investigator.

            <p>
              In 2012, Danno was 66 years old and getting his life back on track
              yet again; the house he had bought right before the Great
              Recession went into foreclosure and he had to declare bankruptcy.
              Financially, he was still underwater, which meant a lot of grunt
              work to keep the lights on. Many of Danno's jobs came from
              tabloids and television news programs. He spent a lot of his time
              running exhaustive database searches at his desk. Then, as now, he
              kept his files meticulously organized on his computer. Beside it
              was a tray covered in his various medications, including insulin
              he injected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno says that Hanson called him for the first time on July 19,
              2012. It was nearly a year after the incident in Australia,
              Cipriani had just returned from Costa Rica, and Hanson was running
              out of patience. But Danno says he didn't know about any of that.
              He wouldn't until much later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno told me that Hanson identified himself as a former USC
              football player who was self-employed as a real-estate developer.
              Hanson had certain people who owed him money, and he wanted
              background checks and personal location searches conducted on
              them. He also wanted to investigate a few prospective business
              partners. Pretty standard stuff for a PI. So Danno agreed to meet
              Hanson at a Starbucks on Wilshire Boulevard in LA's Miracle Mile
              district. After a short conversation there, Hanson handed over 300
              cash and said he'd follow up soon with a list of names.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first two searches Danno ran for Hanson were of Cipriani and
              his wife. A few weeks later, Hanson asked if Danno could help him
              with "collections"—helping convince tenants who owed him money to
              pay. Danno said that wasn't his sort of thing, but he gave Hanson
              the number of a friend of his named Jack Rissell who had fallen on
              hard times and was living in his van.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, the work was piecemeal: Danno ran a few names here and
              a few names there. But in October, something changed. That's when
              Danno says Hanson really became obsessed with Cipriani.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Hanson was arrested last September, multiple news stories
              included the same detail, pulled from a profile of Hanson that ran
              in South Bay Magazine, that seemed to encapsulate everything about
              the playboy athlete turned criminal mastermind: hanging on the
              wall of the office in Hanson's home was a silver-plated AK-47
              stamped with the Louis Vuitton logo.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the profile, titled "Single in Redondo," Hanson comes off as
              harmless and a little cheesy and probably exactly how he wants to
              come off. He talks about the way he remodeled his childhood home
              as a modernist temple, decorated to honor his favorite spots in
              Las Vegas. There is a tequila room. An infinity pool. A man cave
              with the same chairs you might find women getting pedicures in at
              a nail salon ("I bought manicure reclining chairs and had them
              reupholstered with fabric so they don't appear so commercial,"
              Hanson told South Bay.)
            </p>
            <p>
              To outsiders, Hanson might have seemed like he was on the road to
              being a successful entrepreneur. In a sense, he really was. He had
              his tattoos removed. He continued to open up businesses in
              Southern California, including Vapor Berry, a vape business, and
              3Ten Developments, a company he started with family friend Charlie
              D'Agostino—the longtime contractor and former music manager who
              would become a co-defendant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson's friends in Redondo recall seeing him in Armani suits,
              carrying a briefcase around town. He joined a country club. Played
              a lot of golf. Surfed.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It was just a big party," said one friend of Hanson's at the
              time. "It was a tight group of friends that just partied pretty
              hard. Worked hard, played hard. Surf. Volleyball. What you see is
              what you get. I think we all had questions about what those guys
              did, but no one ever really brought it up."

            <p>
              The fact that Hanson ran an offshore gambling site was an open
              secret among his friends in the South Bay at the time—the drug
              trafficking, however, was a real secret. According to court
              transcripts, Hanson was arrested once for drug trafficking but
              managed to avoid charges and had the arrest cleared from his
              record.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Hanson was doing business in Australia, the FBI was
              beginning an in-depth investigation of Macho Sports, the book
              under whose wing he had launched Betodog. Federal agents went
              undercover inside the Macho Sports operation and employed a series
              of wiretaps on suspects.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to a source close to his operation, Hanson got a tip
              from the Portocarrero brothers that they were hot—things were
              going to go badly, and quickly. He and Hilinski rushed to cleave
              their business from Macho Sports. They moved all their offshore
              gambling operations from Peru to Costa Rica. A few weeks after
              Hanson was tipped off, the arrests came down, nabbing 19 people,
              including Jan and Erik Portocarrero. Hanson was relieved to have
              gotten away.
            </p>
            <p>
              What Hanson didn't know at the time is that an FBI agent had
              learned about him while investigating the Portocarrero brothers.
              Charges were brought in the Macho Sports case in June of 2013. The
              FBI's investigation of Owen Hanson began that same month. Soon
              Hanson would end up being a subject of several wiretaps. His
              operation would be infiltrated by an undercover agent, too—a man
              he would know as Al Wilson.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to court transcripts, in the months leading up to his
              arrest, Hanson would allegedly wire 375,000 into a single offshore
              account. He would allegedly make multiple crossings on foot into
              Mexico. He would allegedly tell the undercover agent, the man he
              knew as Al Wilson, that he hoped he was not a cop. Because if
              Wilson was, and Hanson's wife's family found out, Hanson would be
              "six feet under."

              Cipriani says that the threats from Hanson steadily increased over
              a few years. He says the grave desecration and the bad Photoshop
              job were only a small part of a larger campaign of intimidation.
              In the indictment, the federal government alleges that the
              campaign was carried out by Danno and Jack Rissell on Hanson's
              behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the account he typed up after his arrest, Danno wrote that he
              ran searches for Hanson about Cipriani and at one point took
              photos of Cipriani's apartment building in Santa Monica on
              Hanson's behalf. He says that he handed the information and photos
              over to Hanson at the Starbucks and saw Hanson place them in a
              USPS envelope, but that he was not aware of where that envelope
              was going. Hanson says that he never sent anything to Cipriani.
              Rissell did not return multiple requests for comment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani alleges that Rissell stationed himself in a van at the
              door of his apartment building in Santa Monica. He said that
              Hanson, or his agents, placed threatening phone calls to his wife,
              Greice, that were made to look as if they came from Cipriani's
              number, and vice versa. He alleges that Hanson sent flowers to
              Greice with a note that read, "The best of luck with all your
              endeavors -Junior."
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani also alleges—and the government does, as well, in its
              wiretap motion—that Hanson sent him a series of packages through
              the mail that included Cipriani and his wife's social security
              numbers and other personal information, and, later, the doctored
              photos of his family's paint-splattered headstone.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Cipriani, the threats culminated with a DVD, mailed
              first to Greice, and then to Cipriani himself. The DVD begins with
              the camera centered on two masked men, one of whom is carrying a
              machine gun. A subtitle, written in Spanish, appears on-screen:
              "If you don't pay us money, this will happen to you."
            </p>
            <p>
              "We found your mother," the man with the machine gun says. "You
              know that we are not playing games."
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't pay, the man says, you should tell us who you want us
              kill first: you or your wife. Then the DVD cuts to a clip of two
              men being beheaded, one by chainsaw, and the other with a
              butcher's knife.

            <p>
              Over the summer, defense attorneys from the case, including
              Hanson's, filed a motion to suppress wiretap evidence obtained by
              the FBI. In response, the U.S. Attorney's Office filed a motion
              that outlines some of the tactics used by investigators in the
              case.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to using confidential sources—Cipriani and another
              person who remains anonymous—the FBI tapped three separate "target
              facilities": a cell phone belonging to Hanson, a Gogii text
              messaging account belonging to Hilinski, and an email account
              belonging to Hanson.
            </p>
            <p>
              From these target facilities, the FBI learned, among other things,
              that on July 15, 2013, Hanson did indeed receive an extensive
              background report from Danno Portley-Hanks, including information
              on Cipriani and Greice. The FBI also claims that it was able to
              estimate, with the help of an IRS special agent, that Hanson's
              gambling income between October and December 2012 was at least
              323,179. The wiretap motion does not state how exactly they
              arrived at that figure, only that it came from three bookies. One
              source close to Hanson's operation told me that Hilinski ran the
              software for a number of bookies and online gambling sites, and
              that the number is probably inflated.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the FBI was investigating Hanson, so, says Cipriani, was he.
              Cipriani obtained a copy of Hanson's cell phone contact list and
              started making calls. He says he dialed up Hanson's gambling
              connections, including members of Macho Sports, pretending to be a
              part of the sports-betting scene, and learned about the operation.
              After Hanson's arrest, Cipriani continued to reach out to other
              people in Hanson's contact list, including former NFL tight end
              Jeremy Shockey, who is a close friend of Hanson's.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno told me that a week after he was released by the FBI, he got
              a call from Cipriani. Cipriani said he knew that Danno was the one
              who poured paint on his family headstone. He wanted an apology.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January, after the RICO indictment was announced and the second
              wave of arrests were made, Cipriani—who has always used the press
              to get his message, and his brand, across—began to push his story
              about the case in the media. The New York Post published three
              articles, the third of which appeared in April. Titled "I helped
              the FBI catch a crime boss and they ruined my career," it
              described how, after reports about the incidents in Australia were
              published following Hanson's arrest, Cipriani was banned from
              major casinos in Las Vegas and around the world. As a professional
              gambler, it was the equivalent of being told he couldn't work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani's media push culminated in May, when a local news
              affiliate from Miami broadcast a segment on Cipriani and the case.
              In the segment, the reporter ambushes Shockey outside of his
              apartment. The news crew also came out to Los Angeles. In another
              scene, Danno appears to walk into an interview that's in progress
              to beg forgiveness from Cipriani, who is referred to in the report
              as Individual A. Danno can be seen crying after Cipriani takes his
              hand. The tears were real, Danno told me months later. But he only
              agreed to appear on television because he was desperate. Cipriani
              told him that if he did so, he would speak favorably to the judge
              on his behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani has told me that he has accepted Danno's apology, and
              believes it was sincere, but that he will never be able forgive
              him.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="excerpt mb-30">
            <p>
              In court documents, hearings, and their initial press release
              after the RICO arrests, the federal government put Cipriani and
              his accusations front and center. Last month, the attorneys for
              Hanson, Loville, and D'Agostino filed a Brady motion in court
              seeking evidence to use for impeachment purposes in the event
              Cipriani testifies on behalf of the prosecution.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also began to lay out a case against Cipriani, who they argue
              was actually part of the ODOG conspiracy—not a victim of it, and
              not a hero for bringing it down. Cipriani is, according to the
              motion by the defense, "a man who has used our system of laws to
              perpetuate fraud for self-gain."
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2003, Cipriani pleaded guilty to one count of insurance fraud
              and one count of attempted theft by deception in Pennsylvania in a
              case dating back to his time working in that industry. He says it
              was a trumped-up charge by his brother, a cop in Philadelphia, and
              an ex-classmate from Catholic school who worked for the District
              Attorney, after he and his brother had a falling-out over the care
              of his mother.
            </p>
            <p>
              Included as attachments with the motion are copies of press
              reports about the Hanson case (many of them featuring Cipriani as
              the main source), police files and court records from the
              conviction in Philadelphia, and documents related to a pending
              slip-and-fall lawsuit in which Cipriani is the plaintiff.
              (Cipriani has testified that the injury occurred while he was
              operating as a confidential human source on a pump-and-dump case.)
              Should the Hanson case go to trial, it appears that one of the
              defense's key strategies will be discrediting Cipriani as a
              witness for the prosecution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The matter of Cipriani's importance as a witness speaks to bigger
              questions about the relationship between Cipriani and Hanson, as
              well as the government's case against Hanson.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Brady motion, the defense attorneys state that Cipriani was
              "employed by Mr. Hanson to move money." This echoes the source
              close to Hanson who told me that Cipriani had agreed ahead of time
              to launder money for Hanson. The first section of the motion
              concludes like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              "The inescapable fact is that Mr. Cipriani was an important, yet
              unindicted, member of the alleged conspiracy, and is one of, if
              not the most important, significant witnesses in this case;
              particularly with respect to Mr. Hanson's activities."
            </p>
            <p>
              Either Hanson's lawyers and associates are telling the truth or
              Cipriani and the federal government are. What both sides seem to
              agree on is that Cipriani's testimony is important. It's
              impossible to know how important. Is it that there would be no
              case against Hanson in the first place had Cipriani not gone to
              the FBI, first in Philadelphia in 2012 under the proffer letter,
              and again in San Diego in 2013? Or is it that Cipriani is just one
              of the bricks the FBI has used to build a broad case against
              Hanson that also includes wiretaps and an undercover agent?
            </p>
            <p>
              Cipriani believes that there would be no case without him, but he
              also thinks that there is enough evidence, even without his
              testimony, to put Hanson away. He says that Australian authorities
              have asked him to sign an official complaint about Hanson so he
              can testify in their case against him there, but that for now he
              is taking a wait-and-see approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, Cipriani says he is still unable to gamble at casinos,
              and thus unable to make a living. (I made a number calls to verify
              this and find out why, but as a matter of policy, casinos refuse
              to discuss individual clients.) He recently told me that he plans
              on sending his resume to the Trump Organization—he figures they
              would be open to taking on a person with a less-than-traditional
              employment history. He says he also plans to continue the Robin
              Hood 702 project, even if he can't do so from the floor of a
              casino. He told me he is already working more cases with the FBI
              and the SEC, as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno Portley-Hanks continues to work as a private investigator.
              He's a regular at the same diner in the San Fernando Valley, and
              still sings karaoke every Sunday at Residuals Tavern. He's
              thankful for all that, he says. But he's also on a fixed income.
              Business has slowed down since the arrest. He says his biggest
              client, a tabloid, is waiting for the case to be resolved before
              they will hire him again. With permission from the court, he
              recently took a road trip out to Texas, where he caught up with an
              old friend, the musician and sometimes political candidate Kinky
              Friedman.
            </p>
            <p>
              Danno can't afford to hire his own attorney, and for a while he
              struggled to communicate with his court-appointed defender. They
              are on the same page now after a meeting with the judge. Danno
              remains terrified at the prospect of being convicted. He messed
              up, he says. He knows that. But he insists he had no idea what he
              was getting into with Owen Hanson. If convicted, Danno could lose
              his license, even if he doesn't go to jail.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if he goes to jail? Danno points to the tray of medicine
              bottles and vials beside his computer screen. He doesn't think he
              would survive it.

              Owen Hanson, meanwhile, can only wait. To fill the time, he
              watches television, reads, exercises, things like that. His job as
              an orderly on the floor also gives him something to do during the
              day.
            </p>
            <p>
              During one of our visits, Hanson asked if I had seen the previous
              night's World Series game—he could squint at the guard's
              television through his cell. He also told me that he was following
              the election closely and rooting for Hillary Clinton, who he
              thought might have a less aggressive Justice Department than
              Donald Trump, especially when it comes to drug charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of Hanson's favorite activities in jail is exercising, just
              like it had been on the outside. I asked him once how his prison
              weightlifting routine compared to his workouts at USC, and his
              eyes lit up: he told me that his workout buddy inside was an
              experienced inmate named Stomper who had a face tattoo and a very
              serious gang affiliation. Stomper had shown him how to use water
              bags and other found objects to get a good workout in his cell.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day, Hanson followed up with even more detail in a
              Corrlinks message. One thing he did was use his bed as a weight.
              "There's a strength handed down in this place from the criminals
              in here," he wrote. "No more Met-RX sponsored protein shakes," he
              added. "Now just a pack of tuna and a Top Ramen soup."
            </p>
            <p>
              The Edward J. Schwartz United States Courthouse in downtown San
              Diego is a big block of a building located only a few hundred
              yards from MCC—and it's about as welcoming. On the mornings of his
              court dates, Hanson is woken up at 5 AM by U.S. Marshals,
              strip-searched, and escorted down into a tunnel that runs to the
              Schwartz building, as well as to the more modern courthouse beside
              it. He is then placed in a holding cell with other inmates. They
              are given lunches of processed meat and bread.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the Tuesday afternoon before Thanksgiving, that's where Hanson
              waited for his last shot at bail. After firing Babcock, the
              attorney who had compared his case to a crime novel, Hanson hired
              a lawyer named Mark F. Adams. Adams, with gray hair and a sizeable
              mustache, gives off a calmer, more staid vibe. A few years ago, he
              represented Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, one of the most
              notorious and violent cartel leaders in Mexican history.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of Adams' strategies with Hanson was to try for this final
              shot at bail. It's hard for an attorney to defend a person who is
              already behind bars. On the outside, Hanson could help with his
              defense. In a trial, he could come into the courtroom through the
              front door, wearing a suit. On Tuesday, Hanson entered Courtroom
              1E in the company of a bailiff, wearing his prison khakis.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Thanks for having me back," he told the presiding judge, Mitchell
              Dembin.
            </p>
            <p>Dembin laughed. "It's my job," he said.</p>
            <p>
              The courtroom, which looked like it hadn't been updated since the
              1970s—wood paneling, emerald carpets, brown leather seats—was
              about half-full. Sitting in the second row were Hanson's mother
              and sister. Hanson's mother, a school teacher, was willing to
              place her home in a San Diego suburb and her pension on the line
              as collateral. If Hanson was granted bond, he would subject
              himself to a GPS monitoring device, and live at home with her.
              (Jim, his father, now lives in Montana.)
            </p>
            <p>
              In the initial hearings after his arrest, prosecutors had
              highlighted Hanson's international resources and efforts to obtain
              foreign passports. In his ruling, Dembin agreed that while Hanson
              did not present a danger to society, he was a considerable flight
              risk. This time, Adams sought to address that fear. Hanson, Adams
              argued, "doesn't have any assets or the ability to marshal any
              assets internationally."
            </p>
            <p>
              Hanson sat alone in the jury box, looking at once much older and
              much younger than his 34 years, twiddling his thumbs as his new
              attorney made his case.
            </p>
            <p>
              He remained there as Andrew Young, the Assistant U.S. Attorney,
              took his turn to speak. Hanson's situation, Young said, had only
              gotten worse since he was previously denied bail. Now he was
              facing more severe charges and potentially a longer sentence—his
              incentive to flee, Young argued, was even greater than it had
              been.
            </p>
            <p>
              Young also revealed for the first time that Hanson had trafficked
              "well over a ton of cocaine." He said that after Hanson was first
              arrested, before the superseding indictment was brought, Hanson
              used prison phones to conduct ODOG operations. It's "business as
              usual," Hanson allegedly told co-conspirators from MCC. "Boss's
              orders." Hanson allegedly directed his co-conspirators to continue
              payment on his house in Mexico by personally hauling cash over the
              border.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Judge Dembin denied Hanson bail last year, he said at the
              time that doing so was not his preference. He was a judge, he
              said, who prefers to grant bond whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the months since the RICO arrests were announced, many of
              Hanson's co-defendants have pleaded guilty. One man, arrested by
              mistake, was dismissed without prejudice. Some of Hanson's bookies
              who reached deals were given sentences of five years probation and
              fines based on their financial status. Hilinski, Hanson's COO, has
              pleaded guilty, but has yet to be sentenced. Even Hanson himself
              is working toward a plea agreement, Adams said in court.
            </p>
            <p>It would have to come with Hanson still behind bars.</p>
            <p>
              Judge Dembin thanked Hanson's mother for her willingness to risk
              her assets on behalf of her son. He said he appreciated the
              gesture. If Hanson had the financial resources that the government
              alleged, the money could be paid back to his mother in the event
              that he fled. It was just money, after all. Considering Hanson's
              "facility with other identities and large amounts of cash flying
              around," the judge said, he could not grant bail.
            </p>
            <p>"I think the temptation to disappear is too great."</p>
            <p>
              After the decision, Hanson huddled briefly with Adams as
              spectators left the courtroom before the next case was called.
              Adams then escorted Hanson's mother and sister outside while
              Hanson, accompanied by the bailiff, disappeared behind the
              wood-paneled door for the journey down into the tunnel and back to
              MCC.
            </p>
            <p>
              That night, Hanson sent me a message on Corrlinks. He was
              disappointed with the judgment, having hoped to get out in time
              for a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal. His trial, if he does not
              reach a plea agreement, will begin on Valentine's Day.
            </p>
            <p>"Tough luck today," he wrote.</p>
            <p>"Fight On!"</p>
